It's worth for money sometimes. But sometimes it's worthless . Camera department is very bad .,3
Consider all things good device,4
The phone is overall good according to the price. Camera is okay but the clarity is not too good. Battery is quite good. Easy to handle phone but as i was expecting like all phones now a days this would also have a remote control access for tv and dish but it doesn't have that feature.,4

P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4
"Reviews are very important, today is the first day after installation",4
Wonderful lovely 4K tv,5
Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2

A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM.

Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2

Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4

A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4
"Reviews are very important, today is the first day after installation",4
Wonderful lovely 4K tv,5
Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5

Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5

Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4

A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4
"Reviews are very important, today is the first day after installation",4
Wonderful lovely 4K tv,5
Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5

Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5

Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4

A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4
"Reviews are very important, today is the first day after installation",4
Wonderful lovely 4K tv,5
Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5

Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5

Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4

A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4
"Reviews are very important, today is the first day after installation",4
Wonderful lovely 4K tv,5
Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5

Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5

Good product and nice look I like it Flipkart thank you to you service nice CE but something 4K video is not that special and would be nice.Still the product is right on a low budget! #I will say it is quite good.😄😃😀👍🖐️,5
The clarity of the tv is amazing for the price .,4
MarQ is my trusted brand. Already I have MarQ Washing machine and MarQ conventional microwave oven. All are great products. I love MaQ by Flipkart.,5
Great value for money with awesome picture quality. Connectivity is really good. Superb interface and user friendly apps installation via play store and side loaded. Ok google function is working only upon pressing google assistant key on remote. But it was mentioned on TV Cartoon box as Ok google. If this function works without pressing any key? This will be tremendous choice for users.,5
Very very good but sound is low and pictures 4k videos movies excellent all specific are good our all mi best choice 👍 thank u flip kart very nice,5
A great 4k TV for a very good price. Picture quality is excellent and the colours vivid. The Android TV interface is very responsive because it has 1.5 GB RAM. Connected to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiF instantly. The ribbon stand is a welcome change from all the other budget TV's which have the dual leg stands set very wide. This is one of the main reasons I bought this 4k TV.,5
sound was good on old tv.. but not this,2
P.S - Review after 2 months usage !!,4
